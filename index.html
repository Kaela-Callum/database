    <h1>Created for my SWE 4633 Class</h1>
    <h2>Kaela Callum</h2>
    <p>I grew up with technology in hand and solving problems falls nothing short of what I am passionate about.  I started my official IT education at my local college, Georgia Gwinnet College, on a software developement track. I transferred where I am residing currently at Kennesaw State University working towards a computer science degree. Currently a senior, I plan to graduate in December of 2022. I have many intrests from managing data bases to developing applications on different platforms; however, I have no plans on a particular future carrer. On the other hand, I do have some interships lined up and scheduled during the summer of 2022. Although my ensuing days after graduating is unclear, I chose to pursuit computer science for my creative outlet.</p>
